# DistinctColors

Generates a list of colors distinct from each other (consecutively).
Nice for programmatically assigning colors to elements in a list (users, ...).

## Example

![Distinct colors for saturation 1.0 and lightness 0.8 in the HSLuv colorspace](https://github.com/Janiczek/distinct-colors/raw/master/doc/colors.png)

These colors have been generated with saturation `1.0` and lightness `0.8` in the HSLuv colorspace.
